# StrategyPattern
This is simple example of Strategy Pattern

We have one abstract class for Duck

3 subclasses extends Duck as 3 types of diffrent ducks and Override common method swimm()

2 interfaces:
 - IFlying for flying type method
   [2 classes implements this interface for 2 types of flying]

 - IVoice for quack style :)
   [3 classes implements this interface for 3 kinds of quacking]
 
MiniDuckSimulator - main class for start program
